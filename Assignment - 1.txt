Q1 Why do computers understand only binary language?
Ans. Computers understand and process information in binary language because their fundamental components, such as transistors and logic gates, operate using binary signals. Binary language uses only two digits, 0 and 1, which correspond to the off and on states of these electronic components.

Here are some key reasons why computers use binary language:

1. Hardware Design: The electronic components within a computer, such as transistors, switches, and circuits, are designed to represent and manipulate binary signals. These components can reliably distinguish between low voltage (0) and high voltage (1) states, making binary the most natural representation for computer hardware.

2. Simplicity and Reliability: Binary language simplifies the design and operation of computer systems. Using a two-digit system reduces complexity and increases reliability by minimizing the chances of errors or ambiguities in interpreting and transmitting signals.

3. Compatibility and Standardization: Binary language provides a universal standard that enables different computer systems to communicate and interoperate. By adopting binary as the common language, computers can share and process information consistently.

4. Digital Representation: Computers are digital devices, which means they work with discrete states or values. Binary language aligns perfectly with the digital nature of computers, allowing them to store, process, and transmit data in a reliable and precise manner.

5. Boolean Logic: Computers process information based on Boolean logic, which deals with binary states (true/false, on/off, 1/0). The use of binary language directly aligns with the logical operations performed by computer circuits and facilitates the implementation of complex algorithms and computations.

While binary language is the foundation of computer processing, higher-level programming languages and software abstractions have been developed to enable easier human-computer interaction. These languages and abstractions provide more human-readable and intuitive representations, which are then translated into binary instructions for the computer to execute.

1. Define Requirements: Understand the purpose and requirements of the software you intend to develop. Determine the features, functionality, and performance expectations.

2. Design: Plan and design the structure and architecture of your software. Break down the system into smaller modules and define their interactions. Determine data structures, algorithms, and the overall flow of the program.

3. Write Code: Start writing the code based on your design. Use a text editor or a code editor to write C code files (.c) that implement the desired functionality. Follow proper coding conventions and best practices to ensure code readability and maintainability.

4. Compilation: Use a C compiler to compile your C code files into machine-readable binary files or object files (.obj). The compilation process checks the syntax, performs type checking, and generates executable code.

5. Linking: If your software consists of multiple source files or requires external libraries, you need to link the object files together. The linker combines all the necessary object files and libraries to create a single executable file.

6. Testing: Test your software to ensure it performs as expected. Write test cases and verify that the software behaves correctly, handles different inputs, and produces the desired outputs. Debug any errors or issues that arise during testing.

7. Debugging and Refining: Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and fix any errors, bugs, or logical issues in your code. Refine your code by optimizing performance, enhancing functionality, and improving the overall quality of the software.

8. Documentation: Document your software by providing user manuals, API documentation, and code comments. Documenting your code and software helps other developers understand and use your software effectively.

9. Deployment: Once your software is thoroughly tested and refined, prepare it for deployment. Create an installer or package the software for distribution to end-users. Ensure that the software is packaged correctly and can be installed and executed on the target systems.

10. Maintenance: Maintain and support the software after deployment. Address any reported bugs, make necessary updates or enhancements, and ensure the software remains compatible with evolving platforms and technologies.

Throughout the development process, it is essential to follow good software engineering practices, such as modular design, code reusability, version control, and collaboration with other team members (if applicable).

Please note that these steps provide a general outline of the software development process using the C language. The specific steps and their order may vary depending on the project requirements, development methodologies, and the tools and frameworks you choose to work with.

	(iv) To convert a number from the decimal number system to the binary number system, you can follow these steps:

1. Start with the decimal number that you want to convert to binary.

2. Divide the decimal number by 2 (since binary is a base-2 number system) and note down the quotient and remainder.

3. Take the quotient from the previous step and divide it again by 2, noting down the new quotient and remainder.

4. Repeat this process of dividing the quotient by 2 and noting down the new quotient and remainder until the quotient becomes 0.

5. Write down the remainders obtained in reverse order. These remainders will form the binary representation of the original decimal number.

6. The final result will be the binary representation of the decimal number.

Let's take an example to illustrate the steps. Suppose we want to convert the decimal number 13 to binary:

Step 1: Start with the decimal number 13.
Step 2: Divide 13 by 2, resulting in a quotient of 6 and a remainder of 1.
Step 3: Divide 6 by 2, resulting in a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0.
Step 4: Divide 3 by 2, resulting in a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1.
Step 5: Divide 1 by 2, resulting in a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1.
Step 6: Write down the remainders obtained in reverse order: 1101.

Therefore, the binary representation of the decimal number 13 is 1101.

You can verify the conversion by converting the binary number back to decimal to ensure it matches the original decimal number.
